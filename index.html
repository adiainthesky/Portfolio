    <div class="column-text"><strong>Dinner Parties.</strong>  Though its more difficult these days to have dinner parties with all of the people that I used to, its still something that I am able to do frequently with my roommates. Each week we rotate chefs and take a turn a cooking a meal for the rest of the roomies.  Its a great chance to explore new recipes as well as catch up with one another.
